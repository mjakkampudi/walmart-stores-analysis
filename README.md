# walmart-stores-analysis

For this analysis I have used python pandas and matplotlib.

The `1962_2006_walmart_store_openings.csv` file is available here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/1962_2006_walmart_store_openings.csv

It contains information on Walmart store openings between the years 1962-2006. Some explanations on the meaning of variable names:

- `storenum`: the unique store number (storenumber is an id, not a count)	
- `OPENDATE`: the date the original store was opened
- `date_super`: the date the store became a super store
- `conversion`: whether the original store was converted to a super store
- `STRCITY`: the name of the city where the store is located
- `STRSTATE`: the state where the store is located
